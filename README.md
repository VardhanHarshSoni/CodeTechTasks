Overview of the Projects:

Project 1: Data Processing
Real world data is often clumsy, unorganised and unprocessed. It becomes important to clean this data before applying AI and ML algorithms as without the data being thoroughly pre processed these algorithms don't produce the desired output.
Hence processes like outlier removal, one hot encoding, data type transformations, etc are carried out in this task.

Project 2: Comparison of different AI models
This task is carried out by analysing and comparing outputs produced by four different algorithms namely:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest

and by using various evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC).
These models provide a detailed analysis of  False positive cancer detection .
The results are visualized to facilitate comparison and interpretation of model performance.
